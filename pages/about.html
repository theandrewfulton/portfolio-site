            <p>Hi, my name is Andrew and I’m a junior full-stack developer.
                I graduated from Macquarie University with a Bachelor of Business Administration with a Bachelor of Arts
                in Psychology.
                Finding myself applying for graduate roles in the midst of a global pandemic I decided to take the time
                to retrain and enrolled at Coder Academy to become a developer.
                Before this, I worked in various roles in hospitality, customer service and consulting, as well as
                teaching outdoor education at Summer Camps and mentoring young people.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’ve always had a passion for building things and working on my own projects.
                In 2015 I bought a Raspberry Pi to try and solve a monitoring and management problem with an off-grid
                solar power system.
                While I never managed to solve this problem satisfactorily (for a variety of reasons) it opened my mind
                to the endless possibilities of Linux, Unix, and the Internet of Things.
                Fast forward several years and I co-founded a startup developing a Unix-based operating system designed
                to be modular, and operate across a variety of device types and architectures, from IOT-enabled devices
                to servers.
            </p>
            <p>
                When not working on this, I cultivated interests in other areas, such as training a neural network to
                write excerpts based on Lee Child’s Jack Reacher novels.
                More recently, I have been working with drones and cloud compute clusters to produce highly detailed
                maps and models of farmland for crop analysis and land management.
                I have also begun work on building my own drone platform to experiment further.
            </p>
            <p>When not doing any of the above I enjoy reading books, watching videos about technology, going for walks
                and playing video games.
            </p>
