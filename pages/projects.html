                <h3>Portfolio Site</h3>
                <p> My first attempt at creating a static portfolio site using the 
                    skills I learned in HTML and CSS in the first month of
                    learning to code. It contains a Homepage, About and Contact
                    page in addition to pages for projects and blog posts and
                    templates for individual posts.
                    The site is designed to be easily modified as I develop new skills
                    and work on new projects to showcase my interests and skills
                     as a developer. It also features responsive design to accommodate
                    different screen sizes.

                <h3>Daily Task Tracker</h3>
                <p> Written in Ruby, this command line application helps you create and keep track of 
                    activities you would like to do every day that might form part of a larger goal.
                    The app is designed to give users a "visual reward" for seeing their progress. It
                    is  inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lpvy-xkSNA">Simone Giertz's Every Day Calendar</a>. <br/>
                    
                    Users can create new tasks to track and delete them as needed.
                    Each day users can input whether or not they completed the task or add a previous
                    date to check off. This progress can then be displayed visually in a monthly
                    counter view for each task they have completed. Persistent storage is handled with text files. </p>

                <h3>Fresh Local</h3>
                <p>Fresh Local is built with Ruby on Rails. It is a place to easily buy and sell
                    homegrown produce in your local area, particularly in the context of the
                    COVID-19 pandemic. The target audience is people who grow their own produce
                    in towns and cities in Australia in addition to buyers who want to shop locally,
                    potentially increase their food security or are interested in reducing  their carbon
                    footprint while eating healthily. <br/>
                    Fresh Local makes use of Heroku, TailwindCSS, PostgreSQL, Cloudinary and plugins for user management and permissions. </p>

                <h3>Drone Projects</h3>
                <p>For several years I have been interested in the use of drones in farm
                    management. This began as experimenting with photogrammetry using a DJI
                    Phantom 4 and has culminated in building my own prototype drone for building
                    high resolution, large scale georeferenced maps. These maps are used to measure
                    changes to the property over time and weed management. The processing pipeline
                    consists of running applications from the <a href="https://www.opendronemap.org/" target="_blank">OpenDroneMap</a>
                    project on AWS while the drone hardware and software uses projects in the <a href="https://px4.io/">PX4 ecosystem</a>. </p>
